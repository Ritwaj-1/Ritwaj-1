### Data Anlayst

Right from childhood, I was fond of movies like Sherlock Holmes. A detective puts his problem-solving, research, and quick thinking skills into action to solve cases. As a Data Analyst, I feel myself as a Detective, trying to find hidden patterns and insights from the Data representing visually in an easily understandable way. Like a detective, I try to connect the dots finding the best relation between the attributes. #DataDetective 🕵️
